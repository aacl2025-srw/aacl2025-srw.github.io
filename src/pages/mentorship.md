# Pre-Submission Mentorship Program

The SRW offers students the opportunity to receive feedback prior to submitting their work for review.
The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the studentâ€™s work.
Participation is optional but encouraged.
The pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.

Students wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft through [this OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/Workshop/SRW_Mentorship) by **August 8, 2025**.
The paper needs to be **anonymized**.
The organizers will check the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.

The participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and provide feedback, which will be given by *September 5, 2025*.
This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission.
The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.

You CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring.
If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper.
