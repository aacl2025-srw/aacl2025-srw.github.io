## About the Student Research Workshop

The IJCNLP-AACL 2025 Student Research Workshop (SRW) is a forum to bring together students investigating various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and to receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community.

The workshop's goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including highschool, undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research.

Check our [website](https://aacl2025-srw.github.io/) for the latest updates!

## General Submission Information

We invite papers in two different categories:

- **Thesis Proposals**: This category is appropriate for PhD students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work.

- **Research Papers**: Papers in this category can describe completed work, or work in progress with preliminary results.
For these papers, the first author MUST BE a current student.
Topics of interest for the SRW are the same as for the main IJCNLP-AACL 2025 conference.

Submissions (in both categories) may be archival or non-archival, based on the wish of the authors.
All archival papers will be published in the IJCNLP-AACL 2025 SRW Proceedings.
Non-archival papers may be submitted to any venue in the future except for another SRW. 

## Why Submit to IJCNLP-AACL SRW?

There are many good reasons to submit to the IJCNLP-AACL SRW, such as:

- **Mentorship program**: IJCNLP-AACL SRW provides a unique opportunity for students to receive constructive feedback and to improve their work through a pre-submission mentorship program. For more information on mentorship, please check the [Pre-Submission Mentorship Program](/mentorship).

- **Improving your publication record**: Publishing a paper as an undergraduate or as a MSc/MA student is beneficial when applying for a PhD program.
Publishing a paper in an IJCNLP-AACL SRW can be really helpful for improving students’ publication record.

- **Explorative Studies**: We encourage the submission of studies with positive and negative results providing insights on why and in which scenarios a particular method succeeds and fails.

All accepted papers and thesis proposals will be presented either as oral presentations or during poster sessions, which will give students an opportunity to interact with and to present their work to a large and diverse audience, including top researchers in the field and assigned mentors.

## Pre-Submission Mentorship Program

The SRW offers students the opportunity to receive feedback prior to submitting their work for review.
The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student’s work.
Participation is optional but encouraged.
The pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.

Students wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft through [this OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/Workshop/SRW_Mentorship) by **August 8, 2025**.
The paper needs to be **anonymized**.
The organizers will check the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.

The participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and provide feedback, which will be given by *September 5, 2025*.
This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission.
The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.

You CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring.
If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper. 

## Submission Requirements

- **Long papers** consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus an unlimited number of pages for references and supplementary material like the appendix. Upon acceptance, papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages).

- **Short papers** consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus an unlimited number of pages for references and supplementary material like the appendix. Upon acceptance, papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages).

- **Thesis proposals** consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references. The title must begin with "Thesis Proposal:". Upon acceptance, they will be given nine (9) content pages in the proceedings. 

Authors are encouraged to use the additional page to address reviewers’ comments.

Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available either as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj) or via [downloading LaTeX or Word files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).
We strongly encourage participants to use the LaTeX template.
All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in these template files.

For anonymity policy, we follow the [ARR anonimity policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/anonymity/):
> Under the new policy, submissions will remain anonymous during peer review, but authors are free to post and discuss non-anonymous preprints at any time. To protect anonymity during peer review, ARR will take measures to prioritize reviews by reviewers who are not aware of the author identities. Authors are reminded that widely sharing the work will make it harder to recruit reviewers.

### Limitations (required)

Authors are required to discuss the limitations of their work in a dedicated section titled "Limitations".
This section should be included at the end of the paper, before the references, and it will not count toward the page limit.
This includes both long and short papers.
Papers without a limitations section will be desk rejected.
Please note that this section should not introduce new methods, analysis, or results.
We reserve the right to desk reject the submissions that use this section to introduce more content that should have been part of the main paper.
It can only discuss the limitations of the work presented in the main content of the paper.

For additional submission instructions, please check the [Author Guidelines](/guidelines).

## How to Submit

There are two routes for paper submission:

- **Direct Submission**: Papers should be submitted through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/SRW).
Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews.
The review process will follow the [ARR review policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Policies_for_Review_and_Citation).
<!-- The review process will be double-blind. -->
<!-- Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. -->
<!-- Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible. -->

- **ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers**: Papers which have already been reviewed through the ARR system can be committed to the SRW.
These papers will not be re-reviewed.
Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.
ARR papers should be committed through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/Workshop/SRW_ARR_Commitment).
When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the OpenReview ID of your paper.

## Grants

We expect to have grants to offset some portion of students' travel, conference registration, and accommodation expenses. Further details will be posted on the SRW website.
