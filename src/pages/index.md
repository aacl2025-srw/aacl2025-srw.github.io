## Welcome to the IJCNLP-AACL 2025 SRW website!

The IJCNLP-AACL 2025 Student Research Workshop (SRW) will be held in conjunction with IJCNLP-AACL 2025.
It is a forum to bring together students investigating various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and to receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community.

The workshopâ€™s goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including highschool, undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research.

Contact us via email at aacl2025srw@gmail.com for any questions.
