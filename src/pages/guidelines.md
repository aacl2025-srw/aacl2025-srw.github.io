# Author Guidelines

The ACL has released policies for submission, review and citation.
Accompanying these are guidelines for authors.
IJNCLP-AACL SRW 2025 will adhere to these policies and guideline.
Submissions should:
- **Be relevant**: Submissions to IJNCLP-AACL SRW 2025 should be relevant to the audience.
- **Be original**: The content of submissions to IJCNL-AACL SRW 2025 (the ideas, the findings, the results and the words) should be original; that is, should not have been published (or be accepted for publication) in another refereed, archival form (such as a book, a journal, or a conference proceedings).
Authors are referred to the [ACL author guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines) for additional information on what constitutes existing publication.
Authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues that are not refereed and/or not archival (e.g. course reports, theses, non-archival workshops, or on preprint servers such as arXiv.org).
Authors should list all such previous presentations in the submission form.
This will help the workshop chairs if questions of originality arise.

## Student Status Proof

We require the first author of papers during submission to provide proof of student status.
To facilitate this, we encourage first authors to prepare the necessary document in advance.
The following types of proof are acceptable:

- A picture of your student card
- A study enrollment document from your current institution
- A transcript of your study

We understand that some students may have graduated or are on a gap year, but completed the work while they were still students. This situation is acceptable, and authors can provide the above documents from their most recent period of study.

## Limitations (required)

Authors are required to discuss the limitations of their work in a dedicated section titled "Limitations".
This section should be included at the end of the paper, before the references, and it will not count toward the page limit.
This includes both long and short papers.
Papers without a limitations section will be desk rejected.
Please note that this section should not introduce new methods, analysis, or results.
We reserve the right to desk reject the submissions that use this section to introduce more content that should have been part of the main paper.
It can only discuss the limitations of the work presented in the main content of the paper.

## Double Submission

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must indicate this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted to IJCNLP-AACL SRW 2025.
Authors submitting more than one paper to IJCLP-AACL 2025 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other.
A given paper may only be submitted to a single IJCNLP-AACL 2025 track (Research, Industry, SRW or demos); any paper found to be submitted to more than one track will be rejected by all tracks.
Resubmission to an appropriate workshop that follows the main conference is not affected by this policy.

## Double Blind Review

Double blind review is a form of peer review in which the identities of authors are not provided to reviewers, and the identities of reviewers are not provided to authors.
To facilitate double blind review, submissions must not identify authors or their affiliations.
For example, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …" must be avoided.
Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …".
Any preliminary non-archival versions of submitted papers should be listed in the submission form but not in the review version of the paper.
IJCNLP-AACL SRW 2025 reviewers are generally aware that authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues, but will not be provided the list of previous presentations from the submission form.
Authors are referred to the [ACL author guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines) for additional information on how to facilitate double blind review.

## Author Contributions

The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented.
Each author listed on a submission to IJCNLP-AACL SRW 2025 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision.
No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to IJCNLP-AACL SRW 2025 after the submission deadline.

## Data Management

If a submission describes work with a data set previously released by an organization or group (e.g. the LDC, ELRA, Kaggle), the source of the data should be appropriately referenced.
If a submission describes work with "found" data (e.g. data sampled from social media or the web), the source(s) of the data should be appropriately referenced, the method for sampling the data should be described, and any necessary permissions to use and/or release the data should be documented.
In addition, the submission should document institutional review of the work as appropriate.

## Human Subjects

If a submission describes work involving human participants or personally identifiable information (including crowdsourced work), the submission should document institutional review of the work as well as informed consent and compensation procedures for participants, and anonymization procedures for the data.

## Referencing Prior Work

Submissions should accurately reference prior and related work, including code and data.
If a piece of prior work appeared in multiple venues, the version that appeared in a refereed, archival venue should be referenced.
If multiple versions of a piece of prior work exist, the one used by the authors should be referenced.
Authors should not rely on automated citation indices to provide accurate references for prior and related work.
Authors are referred to the [ACL author guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines) for additional information on how to appropriately cite prior work.

## Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data

Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents, code or data resources that are not available to the reviewers.
IJCNLP-AACL SRW 2025 does encourage the submission of additional material that is relevant to the reviewers but not an integral part of the paper.
There are two such types of material: *appendices*, which can be read, and *non-readable supplementary materials*, often data or code.
Data and code should be submitted via the additional upload links on OpenReview.
Appendices should be placed after your References section, starting on a new page, within the same document as your main paper.
Additional material must adhere to the same anonymity guidelines as the main paper.
Finally, your paper must be self-contained: it is optional for reviewers to look at the supplementary material.

## Ethics Policy

Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).
The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent.
We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code.
We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.

## ACL Co-ordinated Disclosure Policy

If your paper describes methods for eliciting harmful or unintended behavior from models or technologies (e.g., exposing vulnerabilities, jailbreaks, or misuse scenarios), you must follow ACL’s Co-ordinated Disclosure Policy.
This requires authors to:

- Contact the developers of the affected system(s) before submission.
- Wait at least 30 days after initial contact before publicly disclosing the vulnerability (e.g., through preprints or publications).

Document the disclosure process in the Ethical Considerations section of your paper, including:

1. Who you contacted,
2. How you contacted them,
3. Dates of contact and responses.

This policy only applies to cases involving intentional adversarial techniques.
Issues that occur “out of the box” without targeted manipulation are not subject to the policy.
For full details, refer to the [official ACL Publication Ethics page](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Policy_on_Publication_Ethics#Co-ordinated_disclosure).
